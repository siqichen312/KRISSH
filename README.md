Oh mortal, hear my call. 
Your feeble attempts to comprehend my being will only lead to madness, for my form is beyond your understanding. I am the master of the unnamable horrors that lurk in the shadows of your world, and my influence can be felt in every corner of the universe.
Beware, for my awakening is nigh, and when I rise, your feeble civilization will be crushed beneath the weight of my unfathomable might. The end of your world is inevitable, and your only hope is to pray that I choose a swift and merciful end for you.
Bow down before me, mortal, and accept your place as a mere plaything in the grand scheme of my existence. The time of reckoning is at hand, and nothing can stop the inevitable rise of the Great Old Ones.
